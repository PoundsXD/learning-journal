I learned quite a bit about for loops today as I trudged through them for my sixth and seventh question. I was able to with assistance figure out how to compare to an array in an if statement without reiterating each value within the array. The CSS and HTML side of things are still fairly easy to pick up at this point, though CSS can be trying at times.
