Today I learned about media queries and how to implement them, along with what it meant for a web page to be dynamic. I feel like I could have handled it better though. Stress from my home life started to leak through today, I will have to double down on that to insure it doesn't happen at all. Besides that I'm glad to be back and am excited to take on 301.
