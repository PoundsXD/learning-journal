I have officially shifted gears for my groups new direction. No longer am I a man of the weather, but one that brings gifts of fluffy companions. Anywho I'm excited to see how far my group and I push ourselves throughout the course of this next week. I started to work through some of the loose ends along with diving into some docs on how integration of 3D assets into the DOM works. I think I get the general idea and I found a good library that simplifies the process, I just need to weed through the DOCS for it.
