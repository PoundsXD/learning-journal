Today I learned how to use functions in js, which turned out to be relatively easy in regards to the content of prior days. Other than that most of the html and css topics that were covered were review for me. The partner based coding lab was a great helped force me to have to know how to verbally direct what I wanted to happen on screen which increased my understanding of the conventions I'm using. Beyond this I'm managing, Brian helped me sort out how links for assignments should be submitted.
