Today I was able to truly able to start processing the information that I had been aiming to cram into my head. Now I'm preparing for the closing of this week by aiming to try to tie up loose end this weekend, though I'm not sure I will get to all of them. I must say this week did seem like hell, but in hind sight I'm wondering why it was so fucking difficult for me.
